# Jayaprakash (JP) Ayyappan

## About me
I'm an avid learner and always hungry to acquire new skills and techniques

## My Strengths
I would say my biggest strength is the ability to remain curious and absorb new knowledge. I am able to apply my wide knowledge or various domains in the Information Technology space to easily translate complex technical comncepts and present them in a format that is easily understandable. 
I have excellent written and verbal communication skills.

## My Values
I believe technology should be used to help us lead better lives.  I also firmly believe in the axiom that people will only use products and services that help them improve their lives in some significant way. My primary driver is to try and figure out what I can do to help build technology-based products that change people's lives.
